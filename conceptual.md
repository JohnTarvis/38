- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
- a/not without near infinite time and processing power

- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
- a/by using the node authentication module a 256 bit encryption is applied to the web token

- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
- a/unit tests test one specific code function, integration tests several functions that call each other and end-to-end tests the entire program

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
- a/a mock database is a representation of a database for quicker access

- What is continuous integration?
- a/continuous integration is testing each time a change is made

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
- a/environment variable affect how a program will run

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
- a/test driven development assures that software will be bug free when it is rolled out, the drawback is it can take longer to develop

- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
- a/json is used everywhere

- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
- a/if it is unclear what the code does or the code is long and complex

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
- a/return prints the results of a search in the db

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
- a/web sockets offer faster communication between client and server

- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?
  a/flask seems easier to use.  I'm better at js than python but only because I've been using it longer, however, flask seems much easier when integrating templates into my apps.
